# Graph Data Base For Scala

`gdb4s` is a graph database implementation with RESTFUL API in Scala.

## Notes

It is my graduation project and so it is very experimental. Do not use it in production environment.

My goals in project is to learn

* Cake Pattern and DI
* Akka, Actors and maximizing IO throughput with actor-io
* Design and implement RESTFUL API with spray
