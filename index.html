            <p>Graph Database for Scala, gdb4s, is a <em>graph-like</em> database that stores triples and support query on different elements of these triples. The elements of triples are <em>subject</em>, <em>predicate</em> and <em>object</em>. They respectivly represents the vertex which the relation goes from, the type of relation and the vertex which the relation goes in. Triples simply represents edges of directed weighted graphs.</p>

            <p>Graph Database for Scala is planned to be used by anyone who develops Semantic Web applications or who develop any application who represents its own data as entities and undeterministic number of relations between entities such as a directed weighted graph and needs an easy to install and use nosql database system.</p>
